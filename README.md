# Projectile Motion Simulator

This interactive web-based Projectile Motion Simulator provides a dynamic visualization tool for physics education. The application allows users to explore the parabolic trajectory of projectiles under the influence of gravity.

## Features

- **Real-time Trajectory Visualization**: The simulator displays the complete parabolic path of a projectile based on physics equations.

- **Adjustable Launch Parameters**: 
  - Launch angle can be precisely controlled using a slider or by direct input, with accuracy to one decimal place (0.0° to 90.0°)
  - Initial velocity can be adjusted from 5 m/s to 50 m/s

- **Interactive Draggable Point**: A red point can be dragged along the trajectory curve, allowing users to examine specific positions along the projectile's path.

- **Distance Measurement**: The simulator displays the direct distance (not displacement) between the origin (launch point) and the current position of the draggable point.

- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.

- **Intuitive Controls**: Simple and user-friendly interface with sliders and input fields for parameter adjustments.

## Educational Value

This simulator serves as an excellent teaching aid for physics instructors demonstrating projectile motion concepts. It helps students visualize:

- How launch angle affects the trajectory shape and range
- The relationship between initial velocity and maximum height/distance
- The changing distance from the origin throughout the projectile's flight

The ability to interact with the trajectory by dragging a point along the curve provides an intuitive understanding of projectile motion that static diagrams cannot achieve.
